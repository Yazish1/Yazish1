## Hey there 👋
I'm Yazish, a student studying Computer Science and Data Science, with a growing interest in areas like Market Analysis and Discrete Matehemtics. I enjoy exploring concepts that challenge the way I think, and I'm always looking for opportunities to learn more and build on what I know. This GitHub is where I track that progress and experiment with new ideas.

You can also check out my LeetCode for problem-solving practice and my Devpost for project submissions and hackathon work.
